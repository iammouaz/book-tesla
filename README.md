## About

Book-a-Tesla is a Rails only API project where your users can create bookings for a given car. With the endpoints, developers can integrate the front-end of their web-app to create users, cars and bookings.

Front-end of Book-a-Tesla can be found [here](https://github.com/Maclenn77/book-tesla-frontend/).

## Description

Rent a Tesla API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

With this API, developers can interact with the database to create, edit or delete users, cars, and bookings.

Check complete documentation with 

`rails s`

And then, open the API docs in the [local server](http://localhost:8000).
